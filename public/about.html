<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hii
 
I'm Sofia! I'm a 19-year-old Computer Science student with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>
<p>

</p>
I'm currently diving into web development and have already completed projects like a movie ranking project and a birthday invite project. </p>

<p>I love combining creativity with technology to build something meaningful and user-friendly. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest tech trends or working on my next big idea.</p>  

<p>Stay tuned for more!
